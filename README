This is an SASL client library for Common Lisp.

* Dependencies
This library depends on the Ironclad cryptography library.  Find it in
Debian (as cl-ironclad) or on cliki.

* Supported mechanisms
Currently PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5 are supported.

* Usage
Create an instance of the mechanism you want to use.  If you want to
get the class name from the mechanism name, use get-mechanism.  E.g:

(let* ((mechanism "DIGEST-MD5")
       (client (make-instance (sasl:get-mechanism mechanism)
       	       		      :authentication-id "username"
			      :password "secret"
			      :service "imap"
			      :host "server")))
  ...
)

Once you have such an instance, call sasl:client-step with the data
you receive from the server (NIL if this is the first roundtrip,
otherwise as a byte vector).  This function returns either a byte
vector to send to the server, or :FAILURE.  Once the server says that
authentication is successful, call sasl:client-step with :SUCCESS, and
proceed _only_ if it returns :SUCCESS.

* Compatibility
I have only tested this code on CLISP, but it should work on other
implementations as well.  The code assumes that CHAR-CODE returns the
Unicode code point for every character in the given arguments.
